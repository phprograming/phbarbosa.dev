        Software Engineer working from design to delivery scalable software products for almost 20 years. I´m able to work in all layers of an application (aka Fullstack Developer) and I´m also have a nice perspective about marketing, product, UX and vision of it.
        I teach online and already teached in the past in graduation and technical schools - this makes me a good fit for positions that combine tech with teaching skills (such as developer/tech advogate or evangelist).
